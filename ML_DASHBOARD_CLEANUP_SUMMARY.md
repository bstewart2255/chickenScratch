# ML Dashboard Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up redundant ML dashboard files to reduce technical debt and improve codebase maintainability.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Updated References
- ✅ Updated `test-ml-dashboard-complete.html` to use `ml-dashboard-v3.html`
- ✅ Updated `Redundant/test-ml-dashboard-complete.html` to use `ml-dashboard-v3.html`

### 2. Created Legacy Archive
- ✅ Created `legacy/ml-dashboards/` directory
- ✅ Moved deprecated files to archive:
  - `ml-dashboard.html` (98KB) - Original dashboard
  - `ml-dashboard-v2.html` (76KB) - Component-level analysis
- ✅ Added `README.md` documenting the legacy files

### 3. Removed Deprecated Files
- ✅ Deleted `frontend/ml-dashboard.html`
- ✅ Deleted `frontend/ml-dashboard-v2.html`
- ✅ Verified only `ml-dashboard-v3.html` remains in frontend

### 4. Updated Documentation
- ✅ Updated `docs/technical-debt-assessment-2025-07-29.md` to mark this issue as resolved

## Results

### Before Cleanup
```
frontend/
├── ml-dashboard.html (98KB)
├── ml-dashboard-v2.html (76KB)
└── ml-dashboard-v3.html (108KB)
```

### After Cleanup
```
frontend/
└── ml-dashboard-v3.html (108KB)

legacy/ml-dashboards/
├── ml-dashboard.html (98KB) - Archived
├── ml-dashboard-v2.html (76KB) - Archived
└── README.md - Documentation
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Confusion**: Only one active dashboard file
2. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 174KB of redundant code
3. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation between active and legacy code
4. **Historical Preservation**: Old versions are archived for reference
5. **Consistent References**: All test files now point to the correct version

## Current Status

- **Active Dashboard**: `frontend/ml-dashboard-v3.html`
- **Legacy Files**: Archived in `legacy/ml-dashboards/`
- **Test Files**: All updated to use v3
- **Documentation**: Updated to reflect current state

## Next Steps

Consider reviewing other redundant files mentioned in the technical debt assessment:
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- One-off debugging scripts
- Temporary data fix scripts
