# CI/CD Pipeline Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **PostgreSQL "root" user error**
   - The CI environment variables have been updated to explicitly set the database user to `postgres`
   - Added explicit environment variables: `PGUSER`, `DB_USER`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`

2. **Missing ApiClient methods**
   - Added `healthCheck()` and `getUserData(userId)` methods to the ApiClient class
   - These methods were referenced in tests but not implemented

3. **Low test coverage**
   - Most test files are using `describe.skip()`, causing them to be skipped
   - Current coverage: ~2-5% (threshold: 20% in jest.config.js, 90% in CI)
   - Need to enable and fix the skipped tests

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Added explicit PostgreSQL environment variables to test steps
- Ensures the correct database user (`postgres`) is used

### 2. Updated `frontend/ApiClient.ts`
- Added `healthCheck()` method
- Added `getUserData(userId: string)` method

### 3. Fixed import in `DatabaseService.test.ts`
- Changed import to include both named exports: `DatabaseService` and `databaseService`

## Next Steps

1. **Enable skipped tests**
   - Remove `describe.skip` from test files
   - Fix any TypeScript errors in the tests
   - Update test expectations to match current implementation

2. **Fix test data generators**
   - Update `TestDataGenerator` to match current type definitions
   - Remove references to non-existent properties

3. **Update coverage thresholds**
   - Either increase test coverage to meet 90% threshold
   - Or temporarily lower CI threshold to match current coverage
   - Gradually increase coverage over time

4. **Database setup for CI**
   - Ensure database migrations run before tests
   - Verify all required tables are created

## Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Set environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/signature_auth_test"
export NODE_ENV=test

# Run tests
npm run test:coverage
```

## Monitoring CI Status

The updated workflow should now:
1. Use the correct PostgreSQL user
2. Have the required ApiClient methods
3. Show which tests are being skipped
