# Checksum Consistency Fix

## Problem
The migration and backup scripts contained inconsistent checksum calculations. Some checksums included the `data_format` field, while others excluded it. This caused checksum mismatches during backup integrity checks and migration validation, potentially blocking the migration process.

## Root Cause
Since the migration changes `data_format` from 'base64' to 'stroke_data', including this field in checksums would cause intentional mismatches. The inconsistent approach across different scripts led to false failures.

## Solution
Standardized all checksum calculations to exclude the `data_format` field, focusing only on the actual data content (`id` and `shape_data`) that should remain unchanged during the migration.

## Files Modified

### 1. `02_backup_procedure.sql`
- **Lines 84-95**: Removed `data_format` from checksum verification
- **Line 160**: Removed `data_format` from backup metadata checksum
- **Lines 181-183**: Already excluded `data_format` (final verification)

### 2. `03_migration_script.sql`
- **Lines 49-54**: Already excluded `data_format` (pre-migration checks)

### 3. `04_post_migration_validation.sql`
- **Lines 66-67**: Removed `data_format` from checksum comparison

### 4. `01_pre_migration_validation.sql`
- **Line 88**: Already excluded `data_format`

## Checksum Formula
All scripts now use the consistent formula:
```sql
MD5(string_agg(id::text || COALESCE(shape_data::text, 'null'), ',' ORDER BY id))
```

## Documentation Added
Added explanatory comments to all checksum calculations:
```sql
-- Note: Checksums exclude data_format field since that's what we're changing in the migration
```

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminates false checksum mismatches
- ✅ Ensures backup integrity checks pass correctly
- ✅ Allows migration to proceed without false failures
- ✅ Maintains data integrity validation for actual content changes

## Testing
After this fix, all checksum comparisons should pass when:
1. Backup is created from original data
2. Migration updates only the `data_format` field
3. Post-migration validation compares the same data content

The checksums will only fail if the actual `shape_data` content is modified, which would indicate a real data integrity issue.
