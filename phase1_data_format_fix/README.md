# Phase 1: Critical Data Format Correction

## Overview
This directory contains all scripts and documentation needed to fix the critical data format mislabeling issue in the signature authentication system. The migration corrects 115 shape records incorrectly labeled as 'base64' format to the correct 'stroke_data' format.

## Issue Summary
- **Problem**: 115 shape records have data_format='base64' but contain stroke data
- **Impact**: Affects ML processing and authentication accuracy
- **Solution**: Update data_format field to 'stroke_data' for affected records
- **Risk**: Low-Medium with comprehensive safety measures

## Files in this Directory

### 1. `01_pre_migration_validation.sql`
Pre-migration validation script that:
- Confirms exactly 115 affected records
- Verifies all have the 'raw' stroke data key
- Generates checksums for validation
- Provides sample data for review

### 2. `02_backup_procedure.sql`
Comprehensive backup procedure that:
- Creates timestamped backup schema
- Backs up affected shapes and related data
- Verifies backup integrity with checksums
- Generates recovery scripts

### 3. `03_migration_script.sql`
Production-ready migration script with:
- Transaction-based batch processing
- Safety checks and error handling
- Progress logging and monitoring
- Built-in validation

### 4. `04_post_migration_validation.sql`
Post-migration validation queries that verify:
- All base64 formats converted successfully
- Data integrity maintained
- Performance metrics acceptable
- Authentication linkages intact

### 5. `05_rollback_script.sql`
Emergency rollback procedure that:
- Restores original data format
- Validates restoration success
- Logs all rollback operations
- Provides detailed status reporting

### 6. `06_execution_checklist.md`
Step-by-step execution guide with:
- Pre-flight checks
- Go/no-go decision points
- Success criteria
- Team responsibilities

## Execution Order

1. **Test in Staging First**
   ```bash
   # Run all scripts in staging environment
   # Validate results match expectations
   ```

2. **Production Execution**
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Validation
   psql -f 01_pre_migration_validation.sql
   
   # Step 2: Backup
   psql -f 02_backup_procedure.sql
   
   # Step 3: Migration
   psql -f 03_migration_script.sql
   
   # Step 4: Validation
   psql -f 04_post_migration_validation.sql
   ```

3. **If Rollback Needed**
   ```bash
   psql -f 05_rollback_script.sql
   ```

## Safety Features

- **Comprehensive Backups**: Table-level and full database backups
- **Checksum Validation**: Ensures data integrity throughout
- **Batch Processing**: Minimizes lock time and system impact
- **Transaction Safety**: All changes can be rolled back
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into migration status
- **Automated Validation**: Multiple checkpoints ensure success

## Success Criteria

The migration is considered successful when:
1. 0 shapes have data_format = 'base64'
2. All 115 records show data_format = 'stroke_data'
3. Shape data content remains unchanged
4. Application functionality verified
5. No performance degradation

## Timeline

- **Preparation**: 30 minutes
- **Execution**: 1-2 hours
- **Validation**: 30 minutes
- **Total**: 2-3 hours

## Support

For issues during migration:
1. Check migration logs in `backup_phase1_data_format.migration_log`
2. Review validation query results
3. If critical issues, execute rollback immediately
4. Contact DBA team for assistance

## Next Steps

After successful completion:
1. Monitor application for 24 hours
2. Keep backups for 30 days minimum
3. Proceed to Phase 2 (Shape Metrics Standardization)
4. Update documentation with lessons learned
