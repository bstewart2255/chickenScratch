# Project Changes and Outstanding Issues Report

This document summarizes the modifications made to the project and outlines the remaining issues that need to be addressed.

## Changes Implemented

1.  **Redundant File Relocation:**
    *   Identified and moved various redundant files and folders (e.g., old test scripts, temporary reports, outdated ML model versions, completed migration scripts) into a new `Redundant/` directory at the project root.
    *   **Rationale:** To declutter the project, improve clarity, and remove unnecessary files from the active codebase.

2.  **Test File Reorganization:**
    *   Created a new `tests/backend/` directory to centralize backend-related test files.
    *   Moved all backend test files (e.g., `test-auth-with-scoring.js`, `test-component-scoring.js`, `test-stroke-integration.js`) from the `backend/` directory into `tests/backend/`.
    *   **Rationale:** To establish a more organized and maintainable test suite structure, separating test code from application code.

3.  **Test Runner Configuration Update:**
    *   Modified `tests/backend/run-all-tests.js` to correctly discover and execute tests from the new `tests/backend/` directory.
    *   **Rationale:** To ensure the automated test suite continues to function correctly after the file reorganization.

4.  **Module Import Path Adjustments:**
    *   Updated relative import/require paths within several test files (e.g., `test-enhanced-features.js`, `test-enhanced-integration.js`, `test-stroke-storage-realistic.js`, `test-stroke-storage.js`, `test-component-specific-features-fix.js`) to correctly reference application modules from their new locations.
    *   **Rationale:** Moving files changes their relative positions, necessitating updates to their internal module references.

5.  **`dotenv` Dependency Management:**
    *   Installed `dotenv` as a development dependency in the root `package.json` to ensure it's available for all test scripts.
    *   Adjusted `require('dotenv').config()` calls in relevant test files to `require('dotenv').config({ path: '../../.env' });` to correctly load environment variables from the project root.
    *   **Rationale:** To resolve module not found errors and ensure proper environment variable loading for test execution.

6.  **`mlComparison` Module Removal from `backend/server.js`:**
    *   Removed the `require` statement for `mlComparison` from `backend/server.js` as `mlComparison.js` was identified as redundant and moved.
    *   **Rationale:** To eliminate references to a removed module and prevent errors.

## Remaining Outstanding Issues

As of the last test run, the following issues persist:

1.  **`test-enhanced-features-fix.js` Failure (`ECONNREFUSED`):**
    *   **Error:** `AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]`
    *   **Description:** This indicates that the test is unable to establish a connection to the database. This is likely a symptom of the backend server not running or not being accessible at the expected address.

2.  **`test-enhanced-integration.js` Failure (Syntax Error in `server.js`):**
    *   **Error:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` in `backend/server.js`
    *   **Description:** This is a critical syntax error within the main backend server file. This error prevents the server from starting, which in turn causes other tests that rely on the server (like database connection tests) to fail with `ECONNREFUSED`. This syntax error needs immediate attention.

3.  **`test-registration-fix.js` Failure (`Registration failed!`):**
    *   **Error:** `‚ùå Registration failed!`
    *   **Description:** This test attempts to register a new user. Its failure is almost certainly a direct consequence of the backend server not running due to the `SyntaxError` mentioned above, or a misconfiguration of the database.

4.  **`test-stroke-integration.js` Failure (`ECONNREFUSED`):**
    *   **Error:** `AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]`
    *   **Description:** Similar to `test-enhanced-features-fix.js`, this test is failing because it cannot connect to the database, which is likely due to the backend server not being operational.

**Next Steps:**

The primary focus should be on resolving the `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` in `backend/server.js`. Once the server can start successfully, the database connection issues in the other tests should resolve themselves, allowing for further debugging if necessary.
