# Documentation Overhaul Report

This report summarizes the changes made to the project's documentation and explains the reasoning behind them.

## Summary of Changes

1.  **Created a new `README.md` file:** This file serves as the central entry point for any developer. It provides a high-level overview of the project, its architecture, and clear instructions for setup and execution.
2.  **Created a new `ARCHITECTURE.md` file:** This file provides a more detailed explanation of the project's architecture, including a diagram and a description of how the different components interact. This will help new developers understand the overall structure of the application and how the different parts work together.
3.  **Created a `docs` directory:** All the existing documentation files have been moved into this directory. This makes the project's root directory cleaner and more organized, and it will be easier for developers to find the documentation they need.

## Reasoning for Changes

The previous documentation was scattered across many files with different naming conventions. This made it difficult for new developers to get up to speed on the project. The changes I've made address this problem by:

*   **Providing a clear starting point:** The new `README.md` file is the first thing a new developer should read. It provides all the information they need to get started with the project.
*   **Explaining the big picture:** The new `ARCHITECTURE.md` file helps developers understand how the different parts of the system fit together.
*   **Organizing the documentation:** The new `docs` directory makes it easy to find the documentation for a specific topic.

## Expected Outcome

These changes will make it much easier for new engineers to join the project and become productive quickly. The documentation is now more organized, more comprehensive, and easier to navigate. This will reduce the amount of time that existing team members need to spend answering questions and helping new developers get up to speed.
