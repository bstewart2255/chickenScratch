# House Component Filtering Fix

## Problem Description

The 'House' component was appearing in authentication attempts even though it was not displayed to users during the sign-in flow. This happened because:

1. **Sign-in Flow Only Shows 6 Steps**: The current sign-in flow only asks users for:
   - Signature
   - Circle, Square, Triangle (shapes)
   - Face, Star (drawings)
   
   **House and Connect-dots are NOT shown to users during sign-in.**

2. **But All Components Were Scored**: When users authenticated with only a signature, the backend generated estimated scores for ALL enrolled components, including 'house' and 'connect_dots' even though they weren't part of the authentication flow.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Filtered Estimated Score Generation

Modified `backend/server.js` to only generate estimated scores for components that are actually part of the current authentication flow:

```javascript
// Define which components are part of the current authentication flow
// Based on the frontend signInSteps configuration
const authFlowShapes = ['circle', 'square', 'triangle'];
const authFlowDrawings = ['face', 'star'];

// Only estimate scores for shapes that are part of the auth flow
hasEnrolledShapes.rows.forEach(row => {
    if (authFlowShapes.includes(row.shape_type)) {
        // Generate estimated score
    }
});

// Only estimate scores for drawings that are part of the auth flow
hasEnrolledDrawings.rows.forEach(row => {
    if (authFlowDrawings.includes(row.drawing_type)) {
        // Generate estimated score
    }
});
```

### 2. Filtered Component Score Storage

Updated the component score extraction to only store scores for components that are part of the authentication flow:

```javascript
// Extract shape scores (only for components in auth flow)
authFlowShapes.forEach(shape => {
    if (scores[shape] !== undefined) {
        shapeScores[shape] = scores[shape];
    }
});

// Extract drawing scores (only for components in auth flow)
authFlowDrawings.forEach(drawing => {
    if (scores[drawing] !== undefined) {
        drawingScores[drawing] = scores[drawing];
    }
});
```

## Result

Now when users authenticate:

- ✅ **Only components from the sign-in flow are scored**: Signature, Circle, Square, Triangle, Face, Star
- ❌ **House and Connect-dots are excluded**: These components no longer appear in authentication attempts
- ✅ **Dashboard shows accurate data**: Only components that were actually part of the authentication process are displayed

## Testing

Use the test script `test-house-filtering.js` to verify the fix:

```bash
node test-house-filtering.js
```

This will confirm that house and connect_dots components are no longer included in authentication attempts.

## Future Considerations

If you want to include house and connect_dots in the sign-in flow:

1. **Update Frontend**: Add house and connect_dots to the `signInSteps` array in `frontend/index.html`
2. **Update Backend**: Add house and connect_dots to the `authFlowDrawings` array in `backend/server.js`
3. **Update Total Steps**: Change `totalSteps` from 6 to 8 in the sign-in flow
