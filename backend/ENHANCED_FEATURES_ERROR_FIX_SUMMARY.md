# Enhanced Features Error Message Bug Fix Summary

## Bug Description

The error message logic for enhanced drawing features was flawed when `ENABLE_ENHANCED_FEATURES` is false. The `_enhanced_features_error` field was incorrectly set by an inverted ternary condition:

```javascript
// BUGGY CODE (before fix)
_enhanced_features_error: strokeData ? 'No stroke data' : 'Stroke data extraction failed'
```

This resulted in 'No stroke data' being reported even when stroke data was present, leading to a misleading 'Extraction Error' when enhanced features were merely disabled.

## Root Cause

The ternary operator logic was inverted:
- When `strokeData` exists (truthy) → should indicate "Enhanced features disabled" 
- When `strokeData` doesn't exist (falsy) → should indicate "No stroke data"

## Affected Components

This bug affected all four drawing components:
1. **Face drawing** (line 1460)
2. **Star drawing** (line 1548) 
3. **House drawing** (line 1636)
4. **Connect dots drawing** (line 1722)

## Fix Applied

Fixed the ternary operator logic in all four instances:

```javascript
// FIXED CODE (after fix)
_enhanced_features_error: strokeData ? 'Enhanced features disabled' : 'No stroke data'
```

## Impact

- **Before**: Misleading error messages suggesting extraction failures when enhanced features were simply disabled
- **After**: Accurate error messages that correctly distinguish between:
  - Enhanced features being disabled (when stroke data exists)
  - Actual missing stroke data (when stroke data doesn't exist)

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
1. When `ENABLE_ENHANCED_FEATURES` is `false` and stroke data exists → "Enhanced features disabled"
2. When stroke data is missing → "No stroke data"
3. When enhanced features extraction fails → Actual error message from the exception
